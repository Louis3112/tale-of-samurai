"Our" Final Project for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in 3rd Semester.

The project is a short turn-based RPG video game developed using Python and pygame. 
The main character is a samurai who battles various *yokai*(Japanese supernatural creatures/spirits) in a classic RPG format.
(github doesn't support samurai emoji :sweat_smile:)

The project implements various of OOP concepts, such as : 
1. Class and Object
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism
5. Relationship

The reason why we are using Python and pygame (rather than Java or other class-oriented programming language) is because pygame provides a user-friendly framework for game development, offering built-in functions and methods that simplify the implementation of game mechanics, graphics, and audio.

For further information, there is a report written in Bahasa Indonesia that you can read from.
